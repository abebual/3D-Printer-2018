# Cura v.15.x Setup Guide for Prusa i3

Download Cura 15.x for your computer:

* Mac - [v15.04.6](http://software.ultimaker.com/current/Cura-15.04.6-MacOS.dmg)
* Windows [v15.02.1](http://software.ultimaker.com/old/Cura_15.02.1.exe)

I've found better luck with the older version of Cura but encourage you to check out newer versions to suit your needs.

This tutorial is based off of the 15.x version but once you undersand the basics, you should be able to configure the newer versions.
